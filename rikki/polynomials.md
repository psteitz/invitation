# Polynomial Functions

## Polynomial definition
Polynomials are expressions of the form $a_nX^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + ... + a_0$ where the $a$'s come from a set of coefficients and the $x$ values are assumed to be in another set.  Polynomials over the real numbers with real coefficents are an important class of real-valued functions of a real variable.
