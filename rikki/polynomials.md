# Polynomial Functions

## Polynomial definition
Polynomials are expressions of the form $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0$ where the $a$'s come from a set of coefficients
and the $x$ values are assumed to be in another set.  Polynomials over the real numbers with real coefficents are an important
class of real-valued functions of a real variable.

A _real polynomial_ $p$ of a real variable $x$ is a function of the form $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0$
where $\\{a_0, ... , a_{n-1}\\} \subset \mathbb{R}$.  The number $n$ is the _degree_ of the polynomial.

We give special names to lower-degree polynomials.

| Degree    | Name | Example |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| 0   | constant | $p(x) = 0$ |
| 1 | linear | $p(x) = 2x - 3$ |
| 2 | quadratic | $p(x) = 4x^2 + x - 7$ |
| 3 | cubic | $p(x) = \pi x^3 - 1$|
