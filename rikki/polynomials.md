# Polynomial Functions

## Polynomial definition
Polynomials are expressions of the form $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0$ where the $a$'s come from a set of coefficients and the $x$ values are assumed to be in another set.  Polynomials over the real numbers with real coefficents are an important class of real-valued functions of a real variable.

A _real polynomial_ $p$ of a real variable $x$ is a function of the form $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0$ where $\\{a_0, ... , a_{n-1}\\} \subset \mathbb{R}$.  Tne number $n$ is called the _degree_ of the polynomial.
