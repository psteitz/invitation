## Function Definition

Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are two sets.  A function from $X$ to $Y$ is a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ such that for every $x$ in $X$ there is exactly one $y$ in $Y$ such that $(x,y)$ is in the set.  Looked at another way, a function maps elements of its domain ($X$) into its range ($Y$). $X$ values are like keys in a dictionary for $Y$ values.

It is not required that every element of $Y$ is the image of some element of $X$ and there may be multiple $x$ values that map to the same $y$.  The only thing that is required is that for each $x$ in $X$ there is exactly one $y$ in $Y$ such that $(x.y)$ is in the function.  Instead of saying $(x.y)$ is in $f$, we write $f(x) = y$. We write $f : X \to Y$ to mean $f$ is a function with domain $X$ and range a subset of $Y$.

## Function examples and non-examples

Which of the following are functions?
{(a, 2a) : a \elt R}
{(\sqrt(y), y) : y \elt R}
{(x, y) : x \elt \R and y = 1 if y is rational, 0 otherwise}
{(x,y) : (x,y) is a point on a circle of radius 1 around (0,0)}

Provide an example of a function that maps multiple input values to the same output value.


## Function properties
A function is *injective* if different $x$ values map to different $y$ values.

A function is *surjective* if every element of the range appears among the values of the function.

A function that is both injective and surjective is called a *bijection*.  Bijective functions can be inverted. 

Provide examples of 
 * a function that is injective, but not surjective
 * a function that is surjective, but not injective
 * a bijection

A set is *countable* if there is an injective function from the set into the natural numbers.

Prove that if a set $A$ is countable then it can be listed out as $a_0, a_1, ... , a_{n-1}, a_n ...$

Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are infinite countable sets then there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$
