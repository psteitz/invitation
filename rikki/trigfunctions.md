# Trigonometric functions
## Pythagorean theorem
Given a right triangle with altitude $a$, base $b$ and hypotenuse length $c$, we have

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Use the Pythagorean theorem to write an expression for the distance between the two points

$(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$

The (Euclidean, metric) *norm* of a point $(x, y)$ in the plane (what we call $\mathbb{R}^2$) is its distance from the origin.
Use the Pythgoran theorem to write an expression for the norm of $(x,y)$.

## Definition of sine and cosine
The *unit circle* is the circle of radius $1$ centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$.  

The circumpherence of the unit circle is $2\pi$. 

The $sin$ and $cos$ functions are defined by considering points on the unit circle as functions of the length of the arc leading to them.

For example, $1/4$ of the way around the circle is $1/4$ of $2\pi$ arc length or $\pi/2$. 

One quarter of the way around the circle counter-clockwise, starting from $(0,1)$ puts us at the point $(0, 1)$ - the top point of the circle.
That means $cos(\pi/2) = 0$ and $sin(\pi/2) = 1$  

The unit of measure when we measure arc length around the unit circle is *radians*.  As arc-length continues past $2\pi$, the values repeat, so

$sin(x \pm 2\pi) = sin(x)$ for all $x$ and same for $cos$. 

## Special values
 1. Find $$cos(\pi/4)$$ using the fact that when $x$ is $\pi/4$, $x$, the angle is 45 degrees, so $sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$ must be the same value.
 2. Find $sin$ and $cos$ for all multiples of $pi/4$ up to $2\pi$.
 3. Use 30-60-90 triangle to fill in values for all multiples of $$\pi/6$$
## Graphs of sine and cosine
 1. Make tables for the sin and cosine functions for the special values (multiples of $\pi/4$ and $\pi/6$)
 2. Create separate graphs for sin and cos by plotting the points and filling in a smooth curve between them
