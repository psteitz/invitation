## Definition of sine and cosine
The *unit circle* is the circle of radius $1$ centered at the origin in the 2-dimensional plane.  

The circumpherence of the unit circle is $2\pi$. 

The $sin$ and $cos$ functions are defined by considering points on the unit circle as functions of the length of the arc leading to them.

For example, $1/4$ of the way around the circle is $1/4$ of $2\pi$ arc length or $\pi/2$. One quarter of the way around the circle counter-clockwise, starting from $(0,1)$ puts us at the point $(0, 1)$ - the top point of the circle. That means $cos(\pi/2) = 0$ and $sin(\pi/2) = 1$  

We call the unit of measure when we measure arc length around the unit circle *radians*.  As arc-length continues past $2\pi$, the values repeat, so

$sin(x \pm 2\pi) = sin(x)$ for all $x$ and same for $cos$. 

## Special values
 1. Find $$cos(\pi/4)$$ using the fact that when $$x$$ is $$\pi/4$$, $$x$$, the angle is 45 degrees, so $$sin(x)$$ and $$cos(x)$$ must be the same value.
 2. Find $$sin$$ and $$cos$$ for all multiples of $$pi/4$$ up to $$2\pi$$.
 3. Use 30-60-90 triangle to fill in values for all multiples of $$\pi/6$$
## Graphs of sine and cosine
 1. Make tables for the sin and cosine functions for the special values (multiples of $\pi/4$ and $\pi/6$)
 2. Create separate graphs for sin and cos by plotting the points and filling in a smooth curve between them
