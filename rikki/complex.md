# Complex Numbers
## Definition
A complex number is a number with two parts: a _real_ part and an _imaginary_ part.

We often write complex numbers $z$ in the form $z = a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are
real numbers and $i$ is the "imaginary unit", $\sqrt{-1}$.

We visualize complex numbers as points in the _complex plane_.  

The complex plane has the real line as its x axis and the imaginary dimension on the y axis.
The complex number $x +yi$ corresponds to the point $(x,y)$.
