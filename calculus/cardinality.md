# Cardinality
A set is finite if it has a finite number of elements. The cardinality of a finite set is the number of elements in the set.  So for example, the cardinality of {"dog", "pig"} is 2. 

It turns out that infinite sets aren't all the same size.

We order infinite sets by size by looking at whether or not they can be mapped into each other 1-1.

If a set can be mapped 1-1 into another set, we consider the first set as no larger than the second one. 

## Cardinality comparison
For sets $A$ and $B$, we write $\lvert{A}\rvert \le \lvert{B}\rvert$ and say $A$ _has cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of_ $B$ if there is an injective function $f: A \to B$.

Show that the cardinality of the natural numbers is no larger than the cardinality of the even numbers.

Show that the cardinality of the integers is no larger than the cardinality of the natural numbers

Show that the cardinality of the rational numbers is no larger than the cardinality of the natural numbers

## Equal cardinalities
Two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality if there is a bijection $f:A \to B$.  In that case, we write $\lvert{A}\rvert = \lvert{B}\rvert$
The [Shroeder-Bernstein Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem) states that if $A$ has cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of $B$ and $B$ has cardinality
less than or equal to the cardinality of $A$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality. In other words, 

$\lvert{A}\rvert \le \lvert{B}\rvert$ and $\lvert{B}\rvert \le \lvert{A}\rvert$ implies $\lvert{A}\rvert = \lvert{B}\rvert$
