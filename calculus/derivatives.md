## Rates of change
One of the most useful concepts in calculus is the rate of change of a function.  By looking at the graph of a function, we can see where it is increasing, decreasing or constant, but we don't yet have a way to tell *how much* a function is increasing or decreasing at different points.  Consider the graph of the function $f(x) = x^3$ below. The function is obviously increasing everywhere, except maybe at $0$ where it looks like it is kind of stalling. Down at the point $(-2, -8)$ the graph looks steeper than it is at $(-1, -1)$.  The same seems to hold at $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 8)$ - the graph is steeper at the second point.  So it looks like for negative values, as $x$ increases, the graph is less steep but for positive values, as $x$ increases, the graph is more steep.

Just looking at the graph and plotting points doesn't give us a precise definition of what "steepness" means in the sense that we have been using that word. 

When you think about it, it's not even obvious exactly what the rate of change means at a point. "How fast is the function increasing/decreasing?"  Generally, when we talk about rates of change, we refer to some kind of interval, not a point.  For example, when we say a car is traveling at 80 miles per hour, we mean that if it keeps going at that same speed it will travel 80 miles in an hour.

Give three more examples of rates of change in physical or social systems. Try to determine how these rates are defined and computed.
