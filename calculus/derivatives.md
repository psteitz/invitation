# Derivatives
One of the most useful concepts in calculus is the rate of change of a function.  By looking at the graph of a function, we can see where it is increasing, decreasing or constant, but we don't yet have a way to tell *how much* a function is increasing or decreasing at different points.  Consider the graph of the function $f(x) = x^3$ below.
