# Adult Swim Math
Adult Swim Math is intended to be a place where adults can come back into mathematics in a calm, relaxed and self-confident environment.
Getting back into math requires first and foremost patience and willingness to go back to elementary things. 
You also need to be willing to do exercises.  You can't learn any mathematics without doing it. 
And you have to agree to the [Code of Conduct]()

## Pace
Adult swim math is not a race. 
In fact, slower is generally better. In a lot of ways, being able to move fast with new concepts requires that you slow way down to make sure that you understand the concepts.
